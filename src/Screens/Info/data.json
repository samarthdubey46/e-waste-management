You are going to want to combine your wet, green items with your dry, brown items. \"Brown\" materials include dried plant materials; fallen leaves; shredded tree branches.For best results, start building your compost pile by mixing three parts brown with one part green materials.  If your compost pile looks too wet and smells, add more brown items or aerate more often. If you see it looks extremely brown and dry, add green items and water to make it slightly moist"

The best time to turn the compost is when the center of the pile feels warm or when a thermometer reads between 130 and 150Â°F. Stirring up the pile will help it cook faster and prevents material from becoming matted down and developing an odor. At this point, the layers have served their purpose of creating equal amounts of green and brown materials throughout the pile, so stir thoroughly."

Add about 4 to 6 inches of compost to your flower beds and into your pots at the beginning of each planting season.\n\nSome gardeners make what's known as compost tea with finished compost. This involves allowing fully formed compost to \"steep\" in water for several days, then straining it to use as a homemade liquid fertilizer."
